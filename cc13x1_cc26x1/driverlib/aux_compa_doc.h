//! \section intro_auxcompa Introduction
//!
//! The COMPA module provides the low-level APIs to manage the
//! high-performance continuous-time comparator located in the AUX domain.
//!
//! The COMPA driverlib module supports the following features:
//! - Operating the COMPA peripheral in MCU active power mode
//! - Selecting the source connected to the positive and reference input of COMPA
//! - Registering/unregistering a callback on the interrupt triggered by COMPA's
//!   output, as well as clearing the interrupt flag
//! - Enabling and disabling the COMPA module
//!
//! COMPA supports the following inputs:
//! - Positive input from:
//!   - Analog-capable I/O pins
//! - Reference input from:
//!   - Analog-capable I/O pins
//!   - Internal chip voltages
//!   - Reference DAC
//!
//! The COMPA driverlib module has the following limitation:
//! - Cannot operate the COMPA peripheral in standby mode
//! - Cannot setup COMPA as a wakeup source from standby
//!
//! COMPA output is routed to the event bus where it holds a dedicated interrupt
//! line.
//!
//! On devices equipped with sensor controller, a CPU application that uses COMPA
//! must configure ownership of the module through AUX hardware semaphores. When
//! using the DAC as reference, ownership of both DAC and COMPA modules is
//! required. The table below shows the conventional matching between AUX
//! semaphores IDs and AUX peripherals:
//! | SMPH_ID | Resource Allocation |
//! |---------|---------------------|
//! | 1       | TDC                 |
//! | 2       | ADC + COMPB         |
//! | 3       | COMPA + ISRC        |
//! | 4       | Reference DAC       |
//! | 5       | Timer2              |
//! | 6       | Unassigned by TI    |
//! | 7       | Unassigned by TI    |
//!
//! COMPA operations are tightly integrated with the reference DAC present in the
//! AUX domain, which can be connected to the reference input of COMPA.
//! When using the DAC as reference for COMPA, it is discouraged to use the
//! RTOS-based DAC driver. The RTOS-based DAC driver has been designed to support
//! the specific use case of driving external loads, therefore it is not compatible
//! with the COMPA driverlib module. When using the DAC as reference for COMPA,
//! use the DAC driverlib module instead, which provides more flexibility and
//! can adapt to this particular use case.
//!
//! \section excode_auxcompa Code example
//! The following code example demonstrates how to set up COMPA with:
//! - an analog IO pin connected to its positive input
//! - the reference DAC connected to its reference input
//! in order to trigger an interrupt on a rising edge of its output.
